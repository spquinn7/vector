# vector
Website that does operations from linear algebra using React, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
http://vector.surge.sh/

Uses dynamic input fields for vectors.

Operations it supports:
  <br />
  -dot products <br />
  -tests for orthogonality <br />
  -distance between vectors <br />
  -norms (length) of each vector <br />
  -scalar multiplication <br />
<br />
Things to add in the future:<br />
  -dynamical input fields for a matrix<br />
  -row reduction of a matrix<br />
  -matrix multiplication<br />
